The simplest way to install Purescript is via Node.js and NPM.

If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can download
it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js up
and running, enter this command into the terminal to install the Purescript
compiler, the Pulp build tool and the Bower package manager.

    npm install --global purescript pulp bower

More information can be found in [the Purescript repository](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

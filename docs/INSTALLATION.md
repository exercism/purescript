# Installation

The simplest way to install PureScript is via Node.js and NPM.

If you don't already have Node.js installed on your computer, you can download
it from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js up
and running, enter this command into the terminal to install the PureScript
compiler and the Spago build tool:

    npm install --global purescript spago

More information can be found in the [PureScript repository](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

# Tests

The PureScript exercise test suites may be run from the exercise directory
using the spago tool:

    cd <exercism-workspace>/purescript/<exercise name>
    spago test

where <exercism-workspace> is the CLI's workspace directory.

For example:

    cd ~/exercism/purescript/accumulate
    spago test

PureScript is a purely functional, statically-typed programming language with
type inference.

**Functional** means that functions are first-class data types.

**Purely Functional** means (roughly) that there are no side effects.
Every function will always return the same value for a given argument
and will do nothing else.

**Statically-typed** means that identifiers have a type set at compile
time--like those in Java, C++ or C#--instead of holding data of any
type like those in Python, Ruby or JavaScript.

**Type inference** means that the compiler will often figure out the
type of an identifier by itself so you don't have to specify it.
Scala and later versions of C# both do this.

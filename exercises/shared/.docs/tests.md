# Tests

The PureScript exercise test suites may be run from the exercise directory
using the spago tool:

    cd <purescript-exercism>/exercises/<exercise-type>/<exercise name>
    spago test

where <purescript-exercism> is the root directory where you checked out this
repository.

For example:

    cd ~/purescript/purescript-exercism/exercises/practice/accumulate
    spago test

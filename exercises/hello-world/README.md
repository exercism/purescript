# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Tips

Purescript setup: `npm install -g purescript pulp bower`

Install project dependencies: `bower install` (inside the "hello-world" directory)

Building: `pulp build` (gotta do this once before the PureScript editor plugins will work)

Running the test: `pulp test`

Submitting: `exercism submit src/HelloWorld.purs`

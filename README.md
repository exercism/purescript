### Asking for help

When in doubt just [open a GitHub issue][new-issue] and ask! In any case,
don't be afraid or shy! We promise to be friendly and as helpful as possible.

### How to contribute

As a first step we recommend you read the [contributing guide][cont-guide].

#### Standard exercise folder strucutre

All exercises live in `exercises` folder. Here's the standard folder structure:

```
<exercise name>
├─ examples
│  └─ src
│     └─ <ExerciseName>.purs
├─ src
│  └─ <ExerciseName>.purs
├─ test
│  └─ Main.purs
└─ bower.json
```

Creating a new exercise requires modification to:

- `examples/src/<ExerciseName>.purs` - put your solution here
- `src/<ExerciseName>.purs` - this should generally only have the module declaration and the exports of the functions that the solution should contain

The other two files:

- `test/Main.purs` - contains tests
- `bower.json` - this is a copy of `etc/bower.json` and should not be directly modified (see the following section)

#### Bower

Due to Travis builds taking too long and timing out, the current build plan compiles and runs the tests for all exercises in a single run. This requires the following:

- A master bower is given in `etc/bower.json`. Test scripts assure this one is used when they are run
  * Please only update the master one and then run `bin/update-bower.sh` to sync them up. 
  * After editing `etc/bower.json`, it is advisable to run `bin/check-bower.sh`. This checks for any discrepancies between various bower scripts.
- Make sure exercises have a single module in `examples/src`

See [this PR](https://github.com/exercism/purescript/pull/71) for more details and the background.

#### Steps for adding a new exercise

- Create a new git branch for the exercise
- Create a directory for the exercise in `exercises` folder with the name of the exercise
- Create directories `examples`, `src` and `test` in your exercise directory
- Use `bin/fetch-configlet && bin/configlet generate . --only exercise-name` to generate the `README.md`
- Use `bin/update-bower.sh` to copy the master `etc/bower.json` to the exercise directory
- Use `bin/configlet uuid` to generate a new UUID for the exercise
- Add exercise details to `config.json`
- Add tests to `test/Main.purs`
- Add your solution to `examples/src/<ExerciseName>.purs`
- Run `bin/test.sh` to make sure all tests pass
- Commit, push and make a pull request
- Check that Travis build goes well

#### Reporting or fixing bugs

Typical examples for a bug: A typo, a missing test case, an unclear or
ambiguous problem description.

- If you are unsure whether you have really found a bug [just ask](#asking-for-help).
- To report a bug you can [write an issue][new-issue]
- If you already have a fix for it you may [write a pull request](#writing-a-pull-request).

#### Reviewing issues and pull requests

Please be detailed and include any links or arguments to support your
opinion.

#### Porting exercises

Here is the [list of missing exercises][missing]. See here for more
information about [porting an exercise][porting]. Of course you can also add a
totally new exercise, but it might be a good idea to first discuss it in one
of [our forums](#asking-for-help).

[porting]: https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md#porting-an-exercise-to-another-language-track


### Repository structure and conventions

[Here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md#track-anatomy)
is a general description of all the files and directories that are not
explicitly described below.


### Writing a pull request
To fix a bug you should [create a pull request from a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) [here](https://github.com/exercism/purescript/pull). See also [here](https://github.com/exercism/docs/blob/master/contributing-to-language-tracks/README.md#git-basics) for more information.
